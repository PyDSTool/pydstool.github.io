<h2 id="head-d6ce7513a7d84689358d010800c5d2f5233dcfbc">1. Project overview</h2>

<p>PyDSTool is a Python-based Dynamical Systems Toolkit. With PyDSTool we aim to provide a powerful suite of computational 
tools for the development, simulation, and analysis of dynamical systems
 that are used for the modeling of physical processes in many scientific
 disciplines, but especially in the biological sciences. We place emphasis on the support of data analysis and model fitting as a core part 
of the process of data-driven modeling. Our focus is on models 
involving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), differential-algebraic
 equations (DAEs), and discrete maps. Our approach differs from <a href="#head-3cb0ad73514d814637d7490bc4f1be8404b30f4e">many existing software packages</a> because of our focus on making model building, simulation, and analysis intuitive and efficient for an<em> advanced</em> end-user (who is unlikely to be either a mathematician or a computer programmer by trade) without sacrificing speed. We say for <em>advanced</em> users because PyDSTool does not provide a graphical interface, but instead a <a href="#head-815e9fc65f67d9a4027299cb950891ed4a3beb72">scripting  environment</a> with flexible, programmable library tools.</p>
 
<p>The software package is written primarily in the high-level interpreted language <a class="external" href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>, and is freely available under the BSD open-source license from the <a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pydstool">SourceForge</a> community website and repository. For certain computationally intensive tasks, code written in C and Fortran can be invoked (without interference or contribution at this level by the user). </p>

<p>In pursuing our aims we have developed a hierarchy of object-oriented
 programming classes available to the modeler.  These classes provide a 
means for “data abstraction”, that is, to provide the user with 
intuitive “objects” that encapsulate common data structures and methods 
for manipulating that data through a well-defined interface. These 
classes naturally make the software highly modular, and they range from 
defining hybrid model simulators, to individual data points, to symbolic
 mathematical expressions, to bifurcation analyzers. Some of these 
classes are built over classes exported by SciPy. We believe that many of these classes have wider scientific utility. </p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The PyDSTool software is "research code" in a Beta stage of 
development, and should not be treated as a complete or comprehensive 
dynamical systems package, with the associated expectation that its 
design and implementation have thoroughly stabilized and have been well 
tested. We have added features as and when we have had a use for them in
 our own research, and have omitted many important features that we 
would love to add if time permits us, or if our research so demands. </p>
<p>You might like to submit feature requests, or you may also like to 
contribute to the code yourself. We are also interested to hear your 
opinions about the possibility of adding some of our classes to SciPy (perhaps in modified form). Please contact us at the <a class="external" href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=140858">SourceForge open discussion forum</a> or via email. </p>

<h2 id="head-427383ec25a31e0aab787f6ca439ef7ab18cb25c">2. Motivation</h2>

<p>A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system">dynamical system</a>
 is defined by a set of rules or transformations for determining how 
points in a multidimensional space move in time. Time may be either 
discrete or continuous. The traces of the points as they move in time 
are called <em>trajectories</em>. The goal of Dynamical Systems Theory 
is to provide a comprehensive description of the geometric structures 
arising from these trajectories. In addition to elucidating the dynamics
 associated with an individual dynamical ssystem, bifurcation theory may
 be used to describe how the dynamics of a system varies with changes in
 parameter values. </p>
 
<p>Interactive numerical and graphical exploration are important tools in dynamical systems research for several reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>There is generally no way to obtain trajectory information other than by iteration or numerical integration.
</li>
<li>The geometric structures of a dynamical system are 
often intricate and extremely sensitive to changes in the system 
parameters, so that interactive computation and graphics are useful in 
interpreting their meaning.
</li>
<li>Exploration of a dynamical system often involves the
 generation of large quantities of data. Usually, only a small portion 
of data needs to be saved in order to concisely record the pertinent 
features of the dynamics. In general it is only through interactive 
exploration of the dynamics that the most compact and efficient 
representations of the a system's dynamics can be determined.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Consequently, there is a critical need for computational environments
 that provide effective tools for exploring dynamical systems with 
minimial effort on the part of the user. The PyDSTool project attempts 
to provide such an environment for use by both casual and advanced 
practitioners of Dynamical Systems Theory. We consider only finite dimensional systems (Ordinary Differential Equations, Differential-Algebraic Equations, mappings) and some forms of infinite dimensional delay systems (also see <a href="http://pydelay.sourceforge.net">pydelay</a>). We do not consider spatially-extended infinite dimensional systems such as Partial Differential Equations, for which other packages exist. We also do not focus on the kinds of heterogeneous "hybrid" systems that are primarily defined by discrete event simulation, as used extensively in process control and engineering applications (for instance see <a href="http://simpy.sourceforge.net/index.html">SimPy</a>).</p>

<p><em>Most of these features are simply not available in the native SciPy ODE integrators or in application-specific solvers.</em></p>


<h2 id="head-815e9fc65f67d9a4027299cb950891ed4a3beb72">4. User interface</h2>

<p>Users of PyDSTool need to be familiar with working in interactive, 
command-line environments such as UNIX or Matlab, including the writing
 of command scripts.  There is presently no graphical interface 
for PyDSTool.  Our emphasis is on the interactivity of a command-line 
and the rapid prototyping possibilities of script-based computing and a programmatic interface. Although there is an initial learning curve, the opportunities for sophisticated calculations are much greater with a programmatic interface than a graphical one.</p>

<p>In building a core library of Python classes, supporting many 
fundamental concepts in dynamical systems modeling, we provide more than
 just a glue with which to interface multiple tools. Our basic object classes store rich "context" that carries a lot of useful 
mathematical baggage.  Through interaction with our Python environment 
at the script level, users can build complex models in a structured way,
 and have access to mathematically intuitive information about the 
models, using the intrinsic context of all the Python objects at the 
heart of their computations. Thus, our user interface model is based on users interactively "querying" (a.k.a. &quot;introspecting&quot;) objects for their attributes and properties. The layers of class abstractions in PyDSTool frees users from dealing with the usual low-level coding details of simulation and data manipulation, and empowers them with mathematically intuitive tools to express their specifications and design their computations in high level, intuitive terms. This also eases the overhead in interfacing the basic numeric classes and simulators with tools 
and utilities such as  parameter estimators or data analyzers. </p>
<p>We believe it is crucial for users to be able to combine the 
  application of tools in a nested or interleaved fashion, in order to 
  make the most flexible and dynamic manipulations of a model.  Such rich 
  combinations may be difficult or imporssible in disjointed software 
  environments, and we believe our community is eager to be able to 
  smoothly set-up and maintain such situations for their own modeling 
  projects. It is a challenge to cleanly and efficiently interface 
  different legacy algorithms with the core Python code in order to 
  maximize the use and re-use of the context associated with the core 
objects. </p>

<p>Users are provided with an interface for the specification of both 
simple and complex dynamical systems models, using minimal programming 
syntax, and a range of options in converting these abstract 
specifications into instantiated numerical solvers for a specific 
system.  Within the same interactive session, users have immediate 
access to analysis tools for continuation, parameter estimation, 
optimization, and so on.  These tools are each tailored for use with the
 core PyDSTool structures to ensure the user has to write as little 
additional computer code as possible.  Extensive documentation for the 
project has been provided online on this wiki. </p>
<p>A key aspect in the design of PyDSTool is the provision of adequate 
diagnostic information and querying utilities for data structures and 
computations.  Users can expect helpful information regarding the status
 of their model development and computations beyond the guidance of the 
online documentation, through in-built querying commands and detailed 
error messages.  The object-oriented nature of the software also 
provides inherent protection of the users’ conceptualization of 
data-flow and control in their PyDSTool scripts. See the <a
href="./UserDocumentation.html">UserDocumentation</a> for more details.</p>

<br>

<h2 id="head-a4c77d1abf45a3b886eaf377a14deb255dba388c">5. Why Python?</h2>

<p>Python has several benefits as a platform for our package.  It is an 
open-source language, enthusiastically developed by a large community of
 people drawn from both academic and commercial backgrounds.  The 
powerful object-oriented and dynamic typing features of the language 
greatly aid in the development of flexible and intuitive data structures
 and user interface (UI) elements.  Being a high level language its 
interactive mode of UI, via a prompt, follows the same principle as that
 of Matlab, and shares the same advantages for quick prototyping, 
querying and scripting of complex object manipulations and computations.
</p>
<p>For more about what Python has to offer in scientific computing see the <a href="./PythonResources.html">PythonResources</a> page
 or a page at the <a class="external" href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonAdvocacyInScientificComputation">python wiki</a>. </p>
 
 <br>

<h2 id="head-2a6c7c8ad1fbf266ad78ffb151fc64cd081a0e9a">6. Design philosophy</h2>

<p>In our design we have emphasized modularized data structures and 
interface design that facilitates data-driven approaches to the modeling
 of physical processes, and we have built upon standard numerical, 
scientific and graphics libraries for Python (for instance, SciPy
 and MatPlotLib).  These, in turn, make use of well-established and 
efficient legacy codes for numerical integration of ODEs, and for 
dealing with linear algebra, optimization, and root solving (for 
instance, the LAPACK and MINPACK Fortran libraries). These legacy codes 
are typically interfaced using <a href="http://www.swig.org/">SWIG</a>.  The low-level languages of these 
codes provide the computational speed that Python itself lacks, in the 
places for which computation is most intensive. </p>

<p>All of the code involved in the PyDSTool project is open source, and 
we have aimed to create as few dependencies on external software 
packages as possible.  In particular, the package can be used with 
Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux machines. </p>

<p>On top of the third-party libraries we have added several new tools 
and capabilities. We have enhanced legacy numerical integration code for
 ordinary differential equations to perform various additional tasks of 
use in hybrid systems modeling, implemented at the C-code level for 
maximal efficiency.  This includes supporting discrete event detection 
during dynamical evolution.  Adding arbitrary user-specified event 
detection to a model permits ODEs and maps to be used in combination as 
"hybrid" dynamical systems. Also, the inclusion of data-based time 
series inputs to a dynamical system’s evolution equations is a feature 
that aids data-driven modeling. </p>

<p>Utilities have been added that allow the movement of data and model 
specifications both in and out of PyDSTool, for sharing in other 
software environments.  As well as basic importing and exporting of 
numerical data as text files, this also includes more systems-level 
interfacing.  For instance, a user can export a dynamical model’s 
definition to a Matlab environment in which Automatic Differentiation is
 available for parameter sensitivity calculations (via the package 
ADMC++).  Also, PyDSTool can be interfaced with the systems biology 
modeling package SloppyCell, through which PyDSTool inherits access to an interface with the Systems
 Biology Markup Language (SBML) for model specification, and the LaTeX 
mathematical markup language.  Further interfaces to packages are in 
active development, such as to the original DsTool and to other simulation tools such as XPP or NEURON. </p>

<h2 id="head-e351142e211032d03807a4fd2b25f23a650f86d3">7. Coming attractions</h2>

<p>Support for the CUDA Graphics Processing Unit parallel computing system is nearly complete (March 2012). Also, there will be better support for interfacing with the SBML model markup language (soon, via PySCes) and the NineML neural system markup language (less soon). More details when they come!</p>

<p>Support for delayed systems is currently limited to dirac delta function pulses, as part of a hybrid system (see <a href="./HybridSystems.html">HybridSystems</a>).
 DDE integrators written by Hairer and Wanner follow the same 
interfacing pattern as our existing integrators and will be added later. </p>
<p>Automatic differentiation and Taylor-series integration capabilities 
will be added once we can get a working interface to an open-source AD 
package such as ADOL-C. In the meantime, we provide a model export tool 
to interface PyDSTool models to work with the ADMC++ environment in 
Matlab, a package that was also developed at Cornell (by Eric Phipps). 
See <a class="external" href="http://www.math.cornell.edu/%7Egucken/PDF/phipps.pdf">this paper</a> about ADMC++ and its application to parameter estimation for periodic orbits. </p>

<p>Although adequately supported in the underlying numerics of Python and SciPy,
 PyDSTool does not presently support dynamical systems having phase 
spaces ranging over the complex numbers. The application of PyDSTool to 
date has been to certain types of model in the physical sciences which 
have not required expressions of complex dynamics. It is hoped that at 
some point this can be redressed with explicitly complex dynamical 
systems. In the meantime, complex dynamics must be represented using 
two-dimensional real number phase spaces, and complex arithmetic 
implemented using auxiliary user-defined functions on 2D reals. </p>
<p>We have successfully tested an update of our automatic generation and
 compilation of C-code, although it does not yet avoid Python's <tt>distutils</tt> package by using <tt>Scons</tt> or <tt>autoconf</tt> / <tt>automake</tt>.
 This updated improves the efficiency of C-based vector field support 
and will make them more easily configured in new installations of 
Python/NumPy/SciPy/Matplotlib/PyDSTool. </p>
<p>We look forward to adding a range of other standard tools that are 
available in other packages for dynamical systems, Poincare maps, support for 
symbolic dynamics and complex dynamics, BVP solvers, averaging tools, 
invariant manifold computations, and so on. </p>

<br>

<h2 id="head-04ffa54d412e4fab86eebdeeeb8accf60dae8b55">8. Historical context (DsTool)</h2>

<p>The <a class="external" href="http://www.cam.cornell.edu/guckenheimer/dstool.html">DsTool</a>
 package was written at Cornell University in the early 1990s under the direction of Prof. John Guckenheimer, and has provided many years of 
functionality to the applied mathematics community. In about 2005, a group of us at Cornell led by Prof. Guckenheimer decided to 
write a new package from the ground up, as our concept of what is needed
 in our community has evolved. Our new project is different from 
existing approaches because it  attempts to combine a large array of 
tools under one, centralized umbrella.  We wish to support both 
straightforward simulation tools, such as numerical integrators of 
differential equations, and sophisticated analysis tools such as 
continuators and parameter estimation / sensitivity tools. </p>
<p>Individually, several examples of the software tools to implement 
these algorithms exist in the world of scientific computing.  However, 
there has not yet been a one-stop solution to providing mathematically 
sophisticated users with a <em>combined</em> suite of such tools that 
are highly integrated and interactively operated.  For instance, Matlab 
is geared much less towards applied mathematicians in this regard as it 
is to physicists and engineers.  It is still typical for applied 
scientists to need to use a variety of separate programs to achieve 
their dynamical systems modeling goals, but increasingly sophisticated 
questions are being asked of the models, which are ever-harder to answer
 when the tools are not integrated.  Example domains that will benefit 
from PyDSTool are computational neuroscience, biomechanics and robotics,
 and advanced engineering projects. </p>

<h2 id="head-3cb0ad73514d814637d7490bc4f1be8404b30f4e">9. Comparison to other packages</h2>

<p>In broad terms, PyDSTool combines or extends a 
range of features from existing packages into an integrated and open environment for<em> modeling complex dynamical systems in scientific applications</em>. There are several existing software packages for working with dynamical systems. There are a variety of features to compare packages by. Some of the major ones are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> user interface</li>
  <li>availability</li>
  <li>efficiency of numerical solving</li>
  <li>types of models that can be simulated</li>
  <li>model building tools and templates</li>
  <li>model analysis tools</li>
  <li>extensibility and inter-operability</li>
</ul>

<p>PyDSTool fills a clear niche in the space of features compared to all existing packages known at the time of writing. This is summarized in the following chart, which is compiled to the best of the author's knowledge and in places may be somewhat subjective (please send any corrections to me by email). An &quot;X&quot; means the feature is supported. The abbreviation &quot;CLI&quot; means Command Line Interface (interactive), &quot;GUI&quot; means Graphical User Interface, and "DIY" means Do It Yourself! Some of the packages in the table are discussed below.</p>

 is written in pure Python (except for the interface to AUTO), and is 
unlikely to work as fast as AUTO, although it is competitive with 
Matcont. The dynamically-linked C code for periodic orbit continuation 
re-uses components of AUTO directly. Because we create a C-code version 
of a vector field, <a href="./PyCont.html">PyCont</a>+AUTO
 is technically a little faster than the most recent full native release
 of AUTO for continuation of periodic orbits, which uses Python 
callbacks to evaluate user-supplied functions. </p>

<h4 id="head-1527acaee7a1ac313890e023243f0b2775e75ab1">9.1.4. Custom code in other languages</h4>

<ul>
<li><p> PyDSTool provides a centralized, general purpose environment. </p>
</li>
<li><p> Python has a strong object-oriented capability. </p>
</li>
<li><p> PyDSTool utilizes automatically-generated and dynamically-linked
 C code for fast execution of user-defined vector fields. Hand-written 
modifications to this C code, or externally written DLL code can also be
 utilized. </p>
</li>
<li><p> Python's dynamic typing makes embedding PyDSTool objects inside other Python computations very simple to set up. </p>
</li>
<li><p> Python's interactive environment (i.e. interpreted language) is 
excellent for exploration of a mathematical system, and introspection of
 the associated PyDSTool objects. </p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="Sundials">9.1.5. SUNDIALS and PySUNDIALS, odeint, etc.</h4>

<p><a href="https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html">SUNDIALS</a>, <a href="pysundials.sourceforge.net/">PySUNDIALS</a>, <a href="http://headmyshoulder.github.com/odeint-v2/">odeint</a>.
These are low level codes for solving ODEs, DAEs, etc. </p>

<ul>
  <li>They require a high level of knowledge both of programming languages such as C++, but also how to install large packages from source.</li>
  <li>They do not have a suite of tools associated with them for doing analysis of other kinds other than integrating the differential equations.</li>
</ul>
  

<h4 id="CAS">9.1.6. Maple, Sage, and other computer algebra systems</h4>

<p><a href="www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a> is an open-source and free mathematics system for Python, styled somewhat like <a href="http://www.maplesoft.com/">Maple</a>. Along with Mathematica, and others, these are Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) primarily.</p>

<ul>
  <li>CAS environments do not focus on the practical side of applied mathematics. They do not provide &quot;in the field&quot; tools for math modeling, especially with regard to applications of dynamical systems.
  <li>They have some solvers for differential equations, but they are not efficient for large systems, nor are they designed for building, managing, or optimizing complex models.
</ul>
<h3 id="head-3130b8037aeabac71c8713c0de4e5104f8a10156">9.2. Application-specific packages</h3>


<h4 id="head-552e2a6102ddd8c39d3994eecb9c50f1eedcbf33">9.2.1. NEURON, GENESIS, Brian, and other neural simulators</h4>

<p><a class="external" href="http://neuron.duke.edu/">Neuron at Duke</a>, <a class="external" href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/">Neuron at Yale</a>, <a class="external" href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">Genesis</a>, and <a href="http://www.briansimulator.org">Brian</a>. These are biophysical neural network simulators.</p>

<ul>
<li><p> A PyDSTool toolkit for compartmental modeling provide templates 
of data structures and utilities for sophisticated hierarchical and 
composable model building, using a modern object-oriented model 
specification language built in to PyDSTool (including symbolic 
expression handling). </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p> The PyDSTool templates are not comprehensive, and are not as 
fully-featured as some of those designed for use with Neuron or Genesis.
  We are working to broaden the support for different types of model. A <a href="./Tutorial/Tutorial_compneuro.html">tutorial</a> is available for PyDSTool's computational neuroscience templates.</p>
</li>
<li>Python interfaces to Neuron and Genesis now exist, but these are add-ons that do not make the underlying systems inherently open to performing dynamical systems analysis.</li>
<li>Brian's simulator is primarily in pure python, although there are speed-ups for larger networks through vectorized calculations. Also, models can be transformed into C and connected to the solvers using weave.</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="SysBio">9.2.2. PySces and other systems biology packages</h4>

<p><a href="http://pysces.sourceforge.net/">PySCes</a> simulator for cellular systems is an open source package.</p>
<ul>
  <li>PySCes does provide some basic tools for dynamical systems analysis of models for systems biology applications.</li>
  <li>PySCes does support a partial interface with SBML.</li>
  <li>PySCes does not support bifurcation analysis and continuation of oscillations.</li>
