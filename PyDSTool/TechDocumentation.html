Leading underscores in the names of attributes, methods or functions suggest that they 
should be treated as "internal" and not for general use, usually because
 they provide no useful function to end-users. Those that might be 
useful for advanced users are also underscored because usage of those 
methods, or direct alteration of those attributes, is difficult to get 
right as an end-user, and mistakes could lead to irreparable damage to 
the object. </p>

<h2 id="head-c269b8efa84a35b1a6877f9975a75d5f8c81fe7c">1. Technical details about numeric types</h2>

<p>Throughout this page, names followed by an asterisk indicate that it 
is not intended for end-users, and usually that the name is present for 
entirely internal usage by PyDStool. Since Python does not provide 
private as well as public interfaces to a class, an asterisk is a 
different type of indication that the name is not intended for typical 
end-user use. </p>

<h3 id="head-05d608e2835c6ea3ae782fbd67fbdd9180104d29">1.1. Note on numeric types</h3>

<p>PyDSTool uses the numpy package to provide double precision floating 
point arithmetic. All floating point calculations in PyDSTool are to 
double precision. By default, Python uses double precision for its <tt>float</tt> type, and we have used the <tt>double</tt>
 type in the C code implementations of numerical integration. Complex 
numbers for data points, numeric intervals, and so forth, are not 
currently supported in PyDSTool. All numeric types mentioned below will 
refer to 32-bit integers or double-precision (64-bit) floats. </p>

<h3 id="head-170087aa02c121e0e41bf494fe6b21848653ff26">1.2. Interval</h3>

<p>This module defines interval ranges and operations for floating point values. This module exports two classes, <tt>Interval</tt> and <tt>IntervalMembership</tt>. See <a href="./Intervals.html">Intervals</a> for general user information.</p>
<h3 id="head-8ce0bcfc3d34ccd337203d9df916e8a7da226356">1.3. Points</h3>

<p>Points and Pointsets are described in detail on their own page: <a href="./Pointsets.html">Pointsets</a> </p>

<h3 id="head-73b2927a78fd5ce571d621388d4c90add92b2827">1.4. Variable</h3>

<p>A <tt>Variable</tt> object is the specification of a single 
variable's value as a function of an independent variable (generally 
time). It is the basic representational unit for a (multi-dimensional) 
trajectory. </p>
<p>A properly configured Variable object <tt>x</tt> is callable, when the argument (independent variable) values are within the set specified by attribute <tt>indepdomain</tt>, which is an <a href="./Intervals.html">Interval</a> object for continuous domains, and an array dictionary for discrete domains. The domain of the variable is given by the <tt>depdomain</tt> attribute, which is also a <tt>Interval</tt> or array dictionary. These intervals default to the bi-infinite real line unless otherwise specified. </p>
<p>The Variable class also provides bounds checking that may be required
 on the independent or dependent variables of a system. If 
bounds-checking is on, calls to a Variable object first pass through a 
filter to verify that the independent variable is within its bounds, 
before the Variable object's <tt>output</tt> method is called. This 
method has different forms depending on the nature of the Generator that
 created it. After this method has produced a value, it will pass 
through an additional filter that checks its boundedness. </p>
<p>The Variable objects that are based on an underlying mesh have a simple form for the <tt>output</tt> method that returns a value. The method is typically an interpolation function that also contains the mesh. The <tt>output</tt> method is more complex for the "on demand" types of trajectory calculator. </p>

<h4 id="head-1d4cebe08ee83e07e9dcf70f9e37b2e701955c0a">1.4.1. Inside the API of the Variable class</h4>

<p>(Follow along in the file <tt>/tests/test_variable_traj.py</tt>).</p>

<p>Wrapping mathematical functions inside the methods of generic objects
 is a sure way to lose call efficiency. Unfortunately, this is a 
necessary expense so that a consistent API is presented to a user or to 
other objects. In particular, such wrapping is necessary in order to 
provide event detection and bounds checking facilities in a unified way.
 For instance, consider a 1D curve that we wish to specify using an 
explicit function, let's say the sine function. In order for the curve 
to be recognizable as such by PyDSTool functions and utilities, the 
explicit function <tt>sin</tt> has to be wrapped into a Variable object, which itself is callable. </p>
<p>To do this, a user would build a ExplicitFnGen generator. For 
simplicity of exposition, and as developers, we can hack a little to 
make the wrapping more transparent. The <tt>OutputFn</tt> class is the 
generic function wrapper for functions that need domain checks enforced 
on the independent variable values passed as arguments, and on the 
output value resulting from the function call. </p>

<div class="codearea" dir="ltr" lang="en"><pre id="CA-3fe0970014eb9ad0e9c983fe61f7cef6f091fd5c_000" dir="ltr" lang="en"><span class="line"><span class="ID">sin_opfunc</span> <span class="Operator">=</span> <span class="ID">OutputFn</span><span class="Operator">(</span><span class="ID">math</span><span class="Operator">.</span><span class="ID">sin</span><span class="Operator">)</span><span class="Text"></span></span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The OutputFn object contains extra information about the types of the
 input and output of the function, and the domains in which those values
 lie. Without additional parameters at initialization, these default to 
(Float, Float) and ([-Inf, Inf], [Inf, Inf]), respectively. We can 
create a Variable object directly, using this OutputFn. </p>

<div class="codearea" dir="ltr" lang="en"><pre id="CA-4f6c8131cdb1d0a1c51f405b159e1bbc7b85f00b_001" dir="ltr" lang="en"><span class="line"><span class="ID">sin_var</span> <span class="Operator">=</span> <span class="ID">Variable</span><span class="Operator">(</span><span class="ID">sin_opfunc</span><span class="Operator">,</span> <span class="ID">Interval</span><span class="Operator">(</span><span class="String">'t'</span><span class="Operator">,</span> <span class="String">'float'</span><span class="Operator">,</span> <span class="Operator">[</span><span class="Operator">-</span><span class="ID">Inf</span><span class="Operator">,</span><span class="ID">Inf</span><span class="Operator">]</span><span class="Operator">)</span><span class="Operator">,</span></span>

</pre>
</div>
<p>In this example, we haven't specified any restriction on the domains,
 but we can investigate the efficiency of this wrapping under different 
calling conditions. Here is the output of a script that measures the 
time taken for 10000 computations of sine. </p>

<pre>Time to compute 10000 calls of sin(0.5) to ...
math.sin

0.666583881471
</pre>
<p>Apart from noticing that math.sin should always be called over the 
universal function sin, there are two lessons for PyDSTool developers 
here. </p>
<p>The first is to call a Variable object with a vector of argument 
values whenever possible. The speed-up of vectorization is approximately
 a factor of 3. </p>
<p>The additional slow-down factor associated with switching on bounds 
checking (checklevel = 2) is about equal when using vectorized calls or 
individual calls. The second lesson is that, where possible, bounds 
checking should be used during exploratory work, but if confidence in 
the input and output bounds is known or gained during the exploration, 
then bounds checking can be turned off for maximum efficiency. </p>

<h3 id="head-924760b76091ce93db932bb4ec1713a1b4b36b9b">1.5. Trajectory</h3>

<p>The <tt>Trajectory</tt> class implements parameterized and
non-parameterized trajectories and curves. It is essentially a collection of 
1D Variable objects brought together (usually under a common
independent variable in parameterized curves) to create an
N-dimensional curve over some domain. The main features to discuss in this 
abstraction are the call method, and the <tt>sample</tt> method, which enables users to sample values from a continuously or discretely defined trajectory in different ways. </p>
<p>Calling the <tt>sample</tt> method with no arguments on a Trajectory 
defined using an underlying mesh will efficiently return the values at 
the mesh points. Trajectories are constructed by <tt>Generators</tt>
(a core PyDSTool class, see <a href="./Generators.html">Generators</a>) using an explicit or implicit function, or
using a mesh of points. When called, the objects return a state value,
using interpolation between mesh points if necessary. Linear and quadratic interpolation are supported. </p>


<h2 id="head-299b2ecf73af3dcb0873530caa926d3431092052">2. Models</h2>


<ul>
<li>Hybrid models are a sub-class of Model so that they can be organized hierarchically, with Generator-only based models as the leaves. Hybrid models use <a href="./ModelInterface.html">ModelInterface</a> objects to allow flexible inter-operability and consistency checking.
</li>
<li>Auxiliary vars of a model are those that are exported by all of its sub-models.
</li>
<li>All sub-models of a hybrid system must "export" the same variables (e.g., see differences in <tt>tests/fingermodel_vode.py</tt>)
</li>
<li>Can promote a Generator's auxiliary variables to be treated as observable or internal vars at 
Model level, provided all sub-models export them. forceObsVars and 
forceIntVars used to promote the auxiliary vars or to change internal 
&lt;-&gt; observable variables (now has no effect if variables already 
of desired type)
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="head-764ab8a29dc39437bdfd8a94d5e11e3d41fad582">3. System specification with FuncSpec</h2>

<p>All user interface routes to defining a dynamical system end up with 
the creation of a FuncSpec object, that contains the full abstract 
definition of a system before it is instantiated to a target language 
definition (as a Generator object). The basics of system specification are detailed on the page <a href="./FunctionalSpec.html">FunctionalSpec</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Sub-classes">3.1. Sub-classes</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><p class="line862">There are three subclasses which are specific to the types of Generator that use them.  The most important one is <tt>RHSfuncSpec</tt>, for use with ODE systems and discrete-time maps. <tt>ExpFuncSpec</tt> is for use with the <tt>ExplicitFnGen</tt> class, for instance. Similarly, <tt>ImpFuncSpec</tt> is used by the <tt>ImplicitFnGen</tt>. These <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span>subclasses can be viewed as simply providing types so that a Generator object can better validate the Func<tt class="backtick"></tt>Spec object passed to it. Presently, these subclasses contain no special functionality, but this might change in future revisions. <span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span>

<h2 id="Initialization_keywords">3.2 Initialization keywords for FuncSpec</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><p class="line862">On initialization, a new Func<tt class="backtick"></tt>Spec object expects a dictionary or <tt>args</tt> object containing keyword-value mappings.

If parameters and external inputs are to be present in the Generator, these are also declared as lists of name strings using the keys 'pars' and 'inputs'. An additional feature in PyDSTool is to allow auxiliary variables to be computed alongside the regular state variables. These variables are declared under the key 'auxvars', but their specifications as algebraic functions of the state, time, and parameters, use the same syntax. The auxiliary variables can also be used for plotting purposes, or for other post-processing analysis and diagnosis of a computed <span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span>trajectory. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line874">A dictionary of strings containing a representations of the <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span>functionality of the Generator is expected under the initialization argument's key 'varspecs'.

<h2 id="head-feaf595c314306386248d7d5ecb1b9ffd57d2e85">4. Dynamically-created functions</h2>

<p>The dual goals of efficiency and convenience in the user 
specification of functions (be they right-hand sides of ODEs, auxiliary 
functions, and so on) are somewhat at odds with eachother. Users are not
 expected to write their own C functions in order to achieve greatest 
efficiency, mainly because of the delicacy of interfacing a large core 
of code with third-party C code correctly. </p>
<p>User-provided functions in native Python are not a great alternative,
 because they are exceptionally slow to execute when embedded in larger 
calculations. This is particularly true if "index-free" notation is to 
be provided to the user, as this creates additional overhead when 
PyDSTool has to map names to array indices and vice-versa on entry and 
exit from every call to the user's functions. </p>
<p>In response to these two extremes, a key feature in the current 
implementation is to allow users to specify partial function signature 
information and function bodies to PyDSTool, using an elementary 
"syntax". PyDSTool then creates its own internal versions of the 
functions as dynamically executed Python code strings. These functions 
are free to use indices as they remain entirely hidden from the user, 
while the user can use names for all the variables, parameters, etc., 
and be free from being concerned about the full detail of function 
signatures, or other interfacing details in order that PyDSTool can use 
the functions correctly. </p>
<p>Additionally, the same user code specifications can be turned into C 
functions for use with external, compiled, modules. This unified feature
 of the user interface is mostly handled in the <tt>FuncSpec.py</tt> module (see <a href="./FunctionalSpec.html">FunctionalSpec</a> page). </p>
<p>Returning to the native Python form for user-specified functions, it 
is most convenient to make these functions accessible to objects as if 
they were regular class methods. Therefore, these functions are 
dynamically added to classes by a command such as </p>
<p><tt>setattr(&lt;class_name&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;func_name&gt;,&nbsp;&lt;ptr_to_func&gt;)</tt>. </p>
<p>In Python, <tt>&lt;ptr_to_func&gt;</tt> is implemented as <tt>eval(func_name)</tt>.
 Furthermore, in order to avoid name clashes in a class's namespace when
 a user creates multiple functions, these functions generally need 
unique internal names. However, when bound to methods that often perform
 the same role in an object, such as functions that specify the RHS of a
 differential equation, the methods must have fixed names that are known
 in advance. Thus, the actual methods created are generally wrappers 
around the unique names, and the unique names remain locally-defined 
functions to the object. </p>

<h3 id="head-4ec6e57158efa9d7b82e8ec5d345692f20c59428">4.1. Object persistence issues</h3>

<p>At present, the major drawback of this approach is the way that Python handles the <em>namespaces</em>
 of objects, with respect to dynamically created attributes and methods,
 and the locally-defined functions that they typically refer to. Many 
important core Python utilities, in particular those that "copy" objects
 and "load" or "save" objects to permanent storage, rely on the contents
 of an object's associated namespace to know what constitutes an object.
 This information indicates how the operations will divide-and-conquer 
their task. Unfortunately, it is the case that locally created functions
 do not appear in the object's namespace (i.e. that designated by <tt>__main__</tt>)
 even when they are referred to by functions that do. Therefore,  
without additional attention, those core operations would fail on such 
objects. </p>
<p>The core classes to which these issues apply are Generator and Variable. In these classes, two special methods <tt>__getstate__</tt> and <tt>__setstate__</tt>
 are defined. These provide overrides for the default behaviour when 
"copy" and "save" operations are invoked. They provide the opportunity 
to do special housekeeping immediately before and after pickling. The <tt>_funcreg</tt> dictionary provides information about the dynamically-created methods that refer to locally-defined functions, and permits <tt>__getstate__</tt> to delete references to those methods prior to pickling. After unpickling, <tt>__setstate__</tt>
 may use the same dictionary to reconstruct those methods from the 
original sources that it holds. Alternatively, the object may call a 
method such as <tt>addMethods</tt> that rebuilds those methods anew. </p>
<p>Read more about object persistence in Python <a class="external" href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-pypers.html">in this article</a>. </p>

<h4 id="head-44a0f68fa69a025dc0b180800830c495b79e643b">4.1.1. Cfunc objects, etc.</h4>

<p>As a postscript to the above discussion of object persistence, 
external Python modules that are largely implemented in C may define 
Python types that are essentially direct "lifts" of C objects. Prime 
examples of these are so-called Python Cfuncs, and numpy uses them for 
the fundamental numeric types <tt>float</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, and <tt>complex</tt>,
 which are thin wrappers around C implementations. The core Python 
utilities for copying, and so forth, do not know how to deal with such 
"third-party" types and throw exceptions. Therefore, an addition to the <tt>__getstate__</tt> and <tt>__setstate__</tt>
 methods discussed above is the temporary re-mapping of such types when 
they appear in object attributes. As a result, most of the core PyDSTool
 classes implement these special methods. </p>

<h2 id="head-0c4bc4052fac544c2e903ad1ebea0a368f2447dc">5. Generator classes</h2>

<p>An introduction to the <tt>Generator</tt> classes is given on the page <a href="./Generators.html">Generators</a>. </p>
<p>In terms of class inheritance, there are two types of Generator: 
those for which time varies continuously, and those for which it varies 
discontinuously. In consequence, all end-user ("concrete") classes 
inherit from either the <tt>ctsGen</tt> or <tt>discGen</tt> abstract classes. </p>
<p>In terms of functionality, there is another distinction here. Some 
generators create trajectory objects that are accurately defined only at
 their underlying mesh-points, others create trajectory objects (curves)
 that compute trajectory points "on demand" to full accuracy (so-called 
dense output). Examples of the first type are the lookup table and the 
standard Runge-Kutta style integrators for ODEs. Examples of the second 
type are the explicit and implicit function generators, for which an 
underlying mesh is not required. Taylor series integration bridges the 
gap between these two extremes, but is currently only accessible via ADMC++ in Matlab (see the <a href="./Generators.html">Generators</a> page). </p>

<h2 id="head-1f331cf99ab0251292916a88295422570a69e666">6. Implementation of numerical integration</h2>

<p>PyDSTool supports several ODE/DAE integrators. See the <a href="./Generators.html">Generators</a> page for more details. </p>
<p>For general information about using these integrators (including some implementation information) see the <a href="./UserDocumentation.html">UserDocumentation</a> page. </p>

<h2 id="head-f47b0850d4cbd3f7457ed37aab7c314ebc80bce7">7. Implementation of numerical continuation</h2>

<p>See the page on the sub-package <a href="./PyCont.html">PyCont</a>. </p>

<h2 id="head-bf174a58679a2b2e5324a4b96a5ba4655619caae">8. Implementation of parameter estimation</h2>

<p>This is done primarily through the MINPACK Fortran libraries, available via SciPy. PyDSTool's <a href="./ParamEst.html">ParamEst</a>
 class is a thin wrapper around these, and provides examples of residual
 cost functions for use with Generator and Model objects. Examples are 
provided in the download, such as the files <tt>pest_test1.py</tt>, etc. </p>

<h3 id="head-29a5a4654cec3782a9bef2dff58b31151c11b6c2">9.1. utils.py</h3>

<p>Important exported functions from this module include: </p>

<ul>
<li><tt>who</tt> is useful in providing information about all PyDSTool-related objects currently named in memory. The function 
behaves much like it does in MATLAB, and takes an optional dictionary 
argument containing PyDSTool objects (such as that returned by a call to
 <tt>local()</tt> or <tt>global()</tt>).
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><p> <tt>orderEventData</tt> transforms the output of the Model class's <tt>getTrajGenEventTimes</tt> method into a list of time-ordered (eventname, time) tuples. If the optional 'nonames' Boolean argument is set to <tt>True</tt>, the function returns only an ordered list of event times, with no associated event names. </p>
</li>

<li class="gap"><p> <tt>makeImplicitFunc</tt> builds a simple implicit 
function representation of an N-dimensional curve, usually specified by 
N-1 equations. Thus the first argument f is generally a function of 1 
variable.  In the case of the 'fsolve' method, however, f may have 
dimension up to N-1, thereby specifying the curve with correspondingly 
fewer equations. Available solution methods are: newton, bisect, 
steffensen, fsolve. All these methods utilize SciPy's MINPACK wrappers to Fortran codes, and do not perform any turning point detection (for which you should see <a href="./PyCont.html">PyCont</a>).</p>

</li>
<li><tt>loadObjects</tt> and <tt>saveObjects</tt> (see <a href="./UserDocumentation.html#head-dde1e664e12cae149618eb5ab400fd75f9624008">user documentation</a> under saving and loading).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="head-ebed813d259b20f15ab720bcc4d1a5b3e2f7deae">9.2. common.py</h3>

<p>This module defines common utility functions for internal use within PyDSTool, or for advanced users. </p>

<h3 id="head-10008a1ed22810cb26149cf78d279e19474cdcdb">9.3. errors.py</h3>

<p>This module contains custom Python exception definitions. Exception 
raising using these classes is not yet consistently applied throughout 
PyDSTool. </p>

<h3 id="head-a1934583fb0ec61daadd7d2d93b5801fe58ee349">9.4. parseUtils.py</h3>

<p>This utility library contains many small functions, primarily useful for developers. It contains functions for manipulating strings, Quantity objects, argument lists, etc.
